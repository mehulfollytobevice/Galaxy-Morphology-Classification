# Classifying Morphology of Galaxies:  
## üìù Description
One of the fundamental questions for the human race is the question of how and why we are here.  Astronomers and astrophysicists are trying to find the answer to this question by studying the origin of celestial bodies like galaxies. Every day, telescopes on Earth and in space are taking high resolution images of distant galaxies. As these telescopes get bigger and better, the datasets begin to explode in size. In order for scientists to effectively study these distant galaxies, it is crucial to sort and classify these images. This project aims at building a convolutional neural network (CNN) based system to accurately predict the morphologies of galaxies. This problem is very interesting and challenging from a machine learning point of view. Firstly, the dataset consists of 61,578 high quality images with 37 corresponding class probabilities. This gives us the opportunity to train accurate models which are generalizable. Secondly, we have a well defined metric (RMSE) which can be used to track model performance for different experimental setups. Finally, we also have the flexibility of experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the most suitable configuration for the task. 

## File organization:
Here's how the project is organized. There are three main folders:
1. <b>trained_models:</b> contains files with the weights of the trained models.
2. <b>code:</b> contains all the source code needed for the different steps in the pipeline.

## ‚è≥ Dataset
The dataset can be found here: [Galaxy Zoo - The Galaxy Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/data)
